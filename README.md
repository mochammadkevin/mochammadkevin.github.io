Hey there! Here, I am building my own portfolio website to showcase my skills in frontend development. As a second-year computer science student at IPB University, I have been honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through both coursework and personal projects.

I am passionate about staying current with the latest developments in technology and continuously seeking out new ways to expand my knowledge and expertise. This portfolio website is my way of demonstrating my capabilities and highlighting my commitment to growing in the field of technology.

Through this project, I am excited to share my work with others and demonstrate my proficiency in frontend development. Thank you for visiting my page and taking the time to learn more about my journey in the world of technology!
